    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>Members of the BEPS Systems team are notorious for leaving their computers unlock when they are away from their
        desk. This presents a major security concern with the team's security liaison and reflects poorly on a
        technology team. A strategy, developed and enforced by the team, to control the neglectful act is to punish the
        violator by incurring a debt in the form of a treat for entire team. A treat is indebted to the violator when a
        co-worker witness the offense and sends an email from the violator's email to the team informing the team that
        the violator will bring in a treat.</p>
    <p>Current tracking application does not suffice the need of the team and records are manually recorded through an
        Excel sheet. This is error prone since recording a violation may be missed and payments may be long overdue with
        no punishment. The BEPS Systems team is in dire need of a way to assist the enforcement of locking their
        computer.</p>
