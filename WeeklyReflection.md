# Weekly Reflection #

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles. 


### Week 1

##### 1/25/2020 - 1.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Evaluate project ideas
 * Download and play around with traveling app:
    * Polarsteps
    * Places Been
    * Countries Been
 
I was pondering on a few project ideas. The two that I'm leaning towards at the moment is a 'treat tracker' that tracks
treats owed by employee. We have this ongoing thing at work where if someone is not at their desk and leave their 
computer unlock, a passing by person can send out an email from the violator's computer to the team about bring in a 
treat. It would be nice to have an application that will track these offensives. The second idea is a traveling
application that tracks a person's movement as they travel and logged the places they've been.

At the moment I'm leaning towards the traveling application since I feel it will be interesting, new, and challenging.
There doesn't seem to be a lot of similar 'traveling' application out there. I've downloaded the three listed above.
Places Been and Countries Been allows a user to select the places that they've been too where as Polarsteps uses a GPS
to track their location.

##### 1/27/2020 - 1.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Decided on Traveling Application for individual project.
 * Create project directory
 * Update project README.md
 * Look into google map API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation
 
I was inspire by how a map become visible to a user in a video game. As the user explore an unknown territory, the map 
opens and becomes available to the user. My long term goal is to implement something similar as my users explore the 
world they live in.

The idea for the traveling application is that it'll track a person's movement as they travel. While traveling to new
place that they haven't been to, that area of the map opens and becomes available to the user. Once the map is available
to the user, information about different attractions also becomes available. The areas that the user have not visited
will be block until the user unlock them by traveling there.

At the time I'm still a little confuse about how to use the google map API to achieve this. There seems to be several 
API available depending on what I want to do. I'm not sure at the moment which to choose and what will work best for me.
More research will be needed.

In terms of my overall project, I feel that there will be a huge lift on the UI side which I don't know if I have the 
skill/knowledge make this happen.

### Week 2

##### 1/28/2020 - 1 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Updated project presentation README.md to include a better project name and description.
* Created my project in Intellij
* Add timeLog.md

##### 1/31/2020 - update

This was a busy week at work. With the work needed to bring home, I haven't had much time to think of the project. At 
the moment, I'm debating if I want to use the time log or just go with a weekly reflection and leaning towards the 
reflection.

### Week 3

##### 02/06/2020 - 2 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Complete screen design using Moqups

I'm not overly thrill with the wireframe that I've created. As I was doing this, I feel that rather that this being a 
web application, this should really be a App for phones. I currently don't have the knowledge to build a App yet. Will
Will have to proceed with this for now.

##### 02/10/2020 - 2 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Complete and add user stories
* Add project plan - edit the provided plan to fit my timeframe

My project plan may need revision. I find it hard to plan for things that we will be learning in this class, but have
limited idea of the details it entails. Overall, I feel that if I can plan for the upcoming weeks and re-edit my plan, 
I'll be in a good place.

##### 02/11/2020 - 2 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Add problem statement
* Extract wireframe from  Moqups
* Create screen design and include wireframe
* Push project to GitHub

### Week 4

##### 02/12/2020 - 2 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Create new project in GitHub and project directory for Treat Tracker
* Update pom file, web.xml file, and add .gitignore
* Add README file
* Add user stories
* Update link to student directory
* Push new documents to GitHub

I decided to change my project idea. My current idea is to create a treat tracker for work. Completed and committed
the above files to GitHub.
